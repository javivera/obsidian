how do i know this is true 

i can calculate this \mathbb{E}(X \mid Z = z) 

how do i know it will coincide with the defnition of condioitnal probaility

**ai**: Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of the transition from elementary probability to measure-theoretic probability. The notation can be confusing, but it connects the abstract definition with the practical calculation you already know.

Let's break down why the statement is true and how it connects to the calculations you're familiar with.

### The Two "Flavors" of Conditional Expectation

It's helpful to think of two different, but related, concepts:

1.  **$\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)$:** This is a **random variable**. It's a function from the sample space $\Omega$ to the real numbers. Its value, $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)(\omega)$, depends on the outcome $\omega$. The crucial property is that this random variable is "$\sigma(Z)$-measurable," which is a technical way of saying its value only depends on the value of $Z$. If two outcomes $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ have $Z(\omega_1) = Z(\omega_2)$, then it must be that $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)(\omega_1) = \mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)(\omega_2)$.

2.  **$\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z = z)$:** This is a **number** (or a function of $z$). It's the expected value of $X$ given that the event $\{Z=z\}$ has occurred. This is what you are used to calculating.

The statement in your note provides the exact link between these two concepts.

### Why the Definition Holds

The formal, measure-theoretic definition of the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ (where $\mathcal{G} = \sigma(Z)$ in your case) is the unique random variable that satisfies two conditions:
1.  **Measurability:** $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ is measurable with respect to $\mathcal{G}$.
2.  **Partial Averaging:** For any event $A \in \mathcal{G}$, we have $\int_A \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G}) dP = \int_A X dP$.

Let's see how this leads to your familiar formula.

1.  **The Measurability Property is Key:** As mentioned above, the fact that $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)$ is $\sigma(Z)$-measurable means its value only depends on the value of $Z$. This implies that there must exist some function, let's call it $g$, such that:
    $$\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z) = g(Z)$$
    This means for any outcome $\omega$, the value of the random variable is $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)(\omega) = g(Z(\omega))$.

2.  **Defining the Number:** We *define* the number $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z = z)$ to be the value of this function $g$ at the point $z$.
    $$\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z = z) := g(z)$$

3.  **Connecting the Two:** Now, let's look at the equation from your note:
    $$\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z = z) = \mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)(\omega) \quad \text{where } Z(\omega) = z$$
    Let's substitute our function $g$:
    *   The left side is $g(z)$.
    *   The right side is $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)(\omega) = g(Z(\omega))$. Since we are only considering $\omega$ where $Z(\omega) = z$, the right side is $g(z)$.
    The equality holds by definition.

### How This Connects to Your Calculation

So, how do we know that this function $g(z)$ is the same thing you calculate using $P(X=x \mid Z=z)$? We use the "Partial Averaging" property.

Let's take the event $A = \{Z=z\}$. This event is in $\sigma(Z)$. The partial averaging property tells us:
$$\int_{\{Z=z\}} \mathbb{E}(X \mid Z) dP = \int_{\{Z=z\}} X dP$$

Let's analyze both sides, assuming for simplicity that $X$ and $Z$ are discrete random variables.

*   **Left-Hand Side:** On the event $\{Z=z\}$, the random variable $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)$ is constant. Its value is $g(z)$, which we call $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z)$. So the integral becomes:
    $$\int_{\{Z=z\}} \mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z) dP = \mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z) \int_{\{Z=z\}} dP = \mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z) P(Z=z)$$

*   **Right-Hand Side:** This integral is the definition of the expectation of $X$ over the event $\{Z=z\}$, which is $\mathbb{E}(X \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{Z=z\}})$. This can be calculated as:
    $$\int_{\{Z=z\}} X dP = \sum_x x \cdot P(X=x \text{ and } Z=z)$$

*   **Equating the two sides:**
    $$\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z) P(Z=z) = \sum_x x \cdot P(X=x, Z=z)$$

*   **Solving for $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z)$:**
    $$\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z) = \sum_x x \frac{P(X=x, Z=z)}{P(Z=z)}$$
    And since $P(X=x \mid Z=z) = \frac{P(X=x, Z=z)}{P(Z=z)}$, we get:
    $$\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z) = \sum_x x \cdot P(X=x \mid Z=z)$$

This is exactly the elementary formula you use for your calculations!

**In summary:** The abstract definition of $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z)$ as a random variable is constructed precisely so that when you "evaluate" it on the set of outcomes where $Z$ takes a specific value $z$, you recover the familiar conditional expectation value $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Z=z)$ that you already know how to compute. The notation in your note is the formal statement of this connection.
