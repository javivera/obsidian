how does it relate to conditional expectation
[Timestamp: 2025/07/20 11:40:41]

**ai**: Of course! Let's break down this section of your note.

This part of your notes is fundamental because it formally connects the abstract definition of conditional expectation (conditioning on a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$) with the more intuitive idea we often use in practice: conditioning on the value of another random variable (or a random vector).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it all fits together.

### 1. The Abstract Concept: Conditional Expectation given a $\sigma$-algebra

Your notes begin by defining conditional expectation, $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is a sub-$\sigma$-algebra of $\mathcal{F}$. This is the most general and powerful definition. The key properties are:
1.  $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ is a $\mathcal{G}$-measurable random variable.
2.  It satisfies the property $\int_G X \, d\mathbb{P} = \int_G \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G}) \, d\mathbb{P}$ for any set $G \in \mathcal{G}$.

The challenge is that "conditioning on a $\sigma$-algebra" can feel very abstract. What does it mean in practice?

### 2. The Bridge: Conditioning on a Random Variable $T$

In many applications, we don't want to condition on an abstract collection of sets $\mathcal{G}$; we want to condition on the information provided by another random variable, let's call it $T$. For example, we want to find the expected value of a random variable $Y$ given that we know the value of $T$.

The proposition you highlighted provides the formal way to do this:
*   We define the "information provided by $T$" as the **$\sigma$-algebra generated by $T$**, denoted $\sigma(T)$.
*   This $\sigma(T)$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega_1$ that makes the function $T$ measurable.
*   The proposition states that this is equivalent to the set of all preimages of measurable sets in the target space: $\sigma(T) = T^{-1}(\mathcal{F}_2) = \{ T^{-1}(C) \mid C \in \mathcal{F}_2 \}$.

So, **conditioning on the random variable $T$ is formally defined as conditioning on the $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma(T)$**. This means we can now consider the object $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid \sigma(T))$.

### 3. The Key Result: The Factorization Theorem (Doob-Dynkin Lemma)

We know from the definition of conditional expectation that $Z = \mathbb{E}(Y \mid \sigma(T))$ must be a $\sigma(T)$-measurable random variable.

This is where the theorem comes in. It states a powerful equivalence:
> A random variable $Y$ is $\sigma(T)$-measurable if and only if there exists a measurable function $g$ such that $Y = g \circ T$ (which is the same as $Y = g(T)$).

In other words, any random variable that can be measured using only the information from $T$ **must be a function of $T$**.

### Putting It All Together: The Connection

1.  We want to compute the conditional expectation of $Y$ given the random variable $T$. We write this as $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid T)$.
2.  Formally, this is defined as $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid \sigma(T))$.
3.  By definition, the result, let's call it $Z = \mathbb{E}(Y \mid \sigma(T))$, is a $\sigma(T)$-measurable random variable.
4.  The theorem then tells us that because $Z$ is $\sigma(T)$-measurable, there must exist a function $g$ such that $Z = g(T)$.

**This is the punchline.** The abstract object $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid \sigma(T))$ can be expressed as a concrete function $g$ applied to the random variable $T$.

$$ \mathbb{E}(Y \mid T) \equiv \mathbb{E}(Y \mid \sigma(T)) = g(T) $$

This justifies the common notation and practice. When we calculate $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid T=t)$, we are finding the value $g(t)$. The random variable $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid T)$ is then the function $g$ applied to the random variable $T$.

The diagram ![[Pasted image 20250525125822.png]] you included perfectly illustrates this. The question "¿Existe $g$ que cierre el diagrama?" (Does a function $g$ exist that closes the diagram?) is answered by the theorem: **Yes**, and that function $g$ allows us to express the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid \sigma(T))$ as a function of $T$.

**user**: how is it that we can treat conditional probabilty as a random variable?
[Timestamp: 2025/07/20 12:45:56]

**ai**: Excellent question. This is one of the most important conceptual leaps in modern probability theory. The key is to see conditional probability as a special case of conditional expectation.

Let's build up the intuition from the ground up.

### 1. Elementary View: A Fixed Number

In basic probability, we learn that the conditional probability of an event $A$ given an event $B$ (with $P(B) > 0$) is a single, fixed number:
$$ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} $$
For example, if we roll a fair die, and $A = \{\text{roll is 2}\}$ and $B = \{\text{roll is even}\}$, then $P(A \mid B) = 1/3$. This is just a number.

### 2. The Bridge: A Function of an Outcome

Now, let's condition on a random variable $Y$ taking a specific value $y$. We write this as $P(A \mid Y=y)$.
Notice that this is still a number, but its value **depends on the value $y$ that we plug in**.

Let's stick with the die roll example.
*   Let $Y$ be the outcome of the roll.
*   Let $A = \{\text{roll is even}\}$.

What is $P(A \mid Y=y)$?
*   If we observe $y=1$, then $P(A \mid Y=1) = 0$.
*   If we observe $y=2$, then $P(A \mid Y=2) = 1$.
*   If we observe $y=3$, then $P(A \mid Y=3) = 0$.
*   If we observe $y=4$, then $P(A \mid Y=4) = 1$.
...and so on.

We have a function, let's call it $h(y)$, where $h(y) = P(A \mid Y=y)$. This function maps possible outcomes of $Y$ to probabilities.

### 3. The Leap: A Random Variable

The crucial insight is to think about the situation **before** the experiment is performed. Before we roll the die, we don't know what the outcome $Y$ will be. Therefore, we don't know what the value of the conditional probability will be. It could be 0 or 1, depending on the outcome of the roll.

Since its value depends on the random outcome of the experiment, it is itself a **random variable**.

The formal definition solidifies this connection by defining conditional probability in terms of conditional expectation.

**The Formal Definition:**

First, recall that the probability of any event $A$ can be written as the expectation of its **indicator function**, $\mathbb{I}_A$:
$$ P(A) = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{I}_A] $$
where $\mathbb{I}_A(\omega) = 1$ if $\omega \in A$ and $0$ otherwise.

We extend this idea to the conditional world. The conditional probability of an event $A$ given a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$ is **defined** as the conditional expectation of the indicator function of $A$:

$$ P(A \mid \mathcal{G}) := \mathbb{E}(\mathbb{I}_A \mid \mathcal{G}) $$

Now, let's connect all the pieces:

1.  From your notes, you know that for any integrable random variable $X$, the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ is a **$\mathcal{G}$-measurable random variable**.
2.  An indicator function $\mathbb{I}_A$ is just a simple random variable.
3.  Therefore, $P(A \mid \mathcal{G})$, being the conditional expectation of a random variable, must also be a **random variable**.

If we condition on a random variable $Y$ instead of a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$, we are simply using the specific $\sigma$-algebra generated by $Y$, i.e., $\mathcal{G} = \sigma(Y)$. So, $P(A \mid Y)$ is shorthand for $P(A \mid \sigma(Y))$.

**Summary:**

*   **$P(A \mid B)$** is a **number**. It's the probability of A, given that B has already happened.
*   **$P(A \mid Y)$** is a **random variable**. It's a function on the sample space $\Omega$. For any outcome $\omega$, its value is $P(A \mid Y=Y(\omega))$. It represents our "best guess" for the probability of $A$, given only the information revealed by the random variable $Y$. Its value is unknown until the experiment is run and we know the outcome of $Y$.

**user**: is X|Y=y a random variable also?
[Timestamp: 2025/07/20 12:49:09]

**ai**: That's another excellent and very important question that gets to the heart of a common point of confusion.

The direct answer is: **No, the notation `X | Y=y` does not represent a random variable in the same sense as `X` or `Y`.**

Instead, `X | Y=y` represents the **conditional probability distribution** of the random variable `X` given that the random variable `Y` has taken on the specific value `y`.

Let's break this down.

### What `X | Y=y` Represents

Think of `X | Y=y` as a new "recipe" or "rulebook" for the random variable `X`. Once we know that `Y=y`, the randomness of `X` might behave differently. This new behavior is described by:

1.  **A Conditional PMF or PDF:** This is a function, $f_{X|Y}(x|y)$, that tells you the probability or probability density of `X` taking on a value `x`, under the condition that `Y=y`.
2.  **A Conditional CDF:** This is a function, $F_{X|Y}(x|y) = P(X \le x \mid Y=y)$, that gives the cumulative probability.

From this conditional distribution, we can calculate specific numbers:

*   **The Conditional Expectation $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y=y)$:** This is a **single number**. It's the expected value of `X` calculated using the conditional distribution.
*   **The Conditional Variance $\mathbb{V}(X \mid Y=y)$:** This is also a **single number**, representing the variance of `X` under the conditional distribution.

### The Contrast: What *is* a Random Variable in this Context?

The confusion often arises because there are closely related concepts that *are* random variables.

1.  **Conditional Expectation $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y)$:** This **is a random variable**.
    *   It's a function of the random variable `Y`. Let's define a function $g(y) = \mathbb{E}(X \mid Y=y)$. Then the random variable $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y)$ is simply $g(Y)$.
    *   **Before** we know the outcome of `Y`, we don't know the value of the conditional expectation. Its value depends on the random outcome of `Y`.

2.  **Conditional Variance $\mathbb{V}(X \mid Y)$:** This **is also a random variable**.
    *   Similarly, let's define a function $h(y) = \mathbb{V}(X \mid Y=y)$. Then the random variable $\mathbb{V}(X \mid Y)$ is $h(Y)$.
    *   Its value depends on the random outcome of `Y`.

### Example from Your Notes

Let's use the bivariate normal example from your notes to make this concrete.
*   $X = X_1$ and $Y = X_2$.
*   The notation **$X_1 \mid X_2 = x_2$** refers to the distribution:
    $$ \mathcal{N} \left( \mu_1 + \Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1}(x_2 - \mu_2), \; \Sigma_{11} - \Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1} \Sigma_{21} \right) $$
    This is a *distribution*, not a single random number.

From this distribution, we get:
*   **$\mathbb{E}(X_1 \mid X_2 = x_2)$**: This is the mean of that distribution, which is the **number** $\mu_1 + \Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1}(x_2 - \mu_2)$.
*   **$\mathbb{V}(X_1 \mid X_2 = x_2)$**: This is the variance of that distribution, which is the **number** $\Sigma_{11} - \Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1} \Sigma_{21}$.

Now, let's look at the corresponding random variables:
*   **$\mathbb{E}(X_1 \mid X_2)$**: This is the **random variable** you get by plugging the *random variable* $X_2$ into the formula for the mean:
    $$ \mathbb{E}(X_1 \mid X_2) = \mu_1 + \Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1}(X_2 - \mu_2) $$
    Its value is random because it depends on the outcome of $X_2$.
*   **$\mathbb{V}(X_1 \mid X_2)$**: This is the **random variable** representing the conditional variance. In this specific Gaussian case, the variance doesn't depend on the value of $x_2$, so it's a constant random variable:
    $$ \mathbb{V}(X_1 \mid X_2) = \Sigma_{11} - \Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1} \Sigma_{21} $$

### Summary Table

| Notation | What it Represents | Is it a Random Variable? | Example Value |

| $\mathbb{E}(X \| Y)$ | The conditional expectation function | **Yes** | A function of Y, e.g., `3Y + 2` |
| $\mathbb{V}(X \| Y=y)$ | The variance of the conditional distribution | **No** (it's a number) | `1.2` |
| $\mathbb{V}(X \| Y)$ | The conditional variance function | **Yes** | A function of Y, e.g., `Y^2` |

**user**: but if X|Y=y is not a random variable how can we tak expected value of it
[Timestamp: 2025/07/20 12:50:32]

**ai**: You've hit on a brilliant and subtle point. This gets to the very heart of the notation.

You are absolutely right that we take the expected value *of* a random variable. The key is that the notation `E(X | Y=y)` is a bit misleading if you read it from left to right.

Here is the correct way to interpret it:

We are **not** taking the expectation of an "object" called `X|Y=y`.

Instead, `E( ... | Y=y)` should be thought of as a single, modified expectation operator.

*   **`E(X)`** means: "Calculate the expected value of the random variable `X` using its standard probability distribution."
*   **`E(X | Y=y)`** means: "Calculate the expected value of the random variable `X`, but use the **new rules** given by the conditional probability distribution that applies when `Y=y`."

### The Analogy: A Recipe

Think of it like a recipe for a cake (`X` is the cake).

*   **`E(X)`** is like asking for the "average deliciousness" of the cake when you follow the standard recipe.
*   Let's say `Y` is the type of oven you use (e.g., `y = 'convection'` or `y = 'gas'`). The oven type changes how the cake bakes.
*   **`E(X | Y='convection')`** is asking for the "average deliciousness" of the same cake (`X`), but baked according to the modified instructions for a convection oven.

You are still finding the average deliciousness of the **cake**, not the average deliciousness of a "cake-given-convection-oven" object. The condition `Y='convection'` changes the *process* of averaging, not the thing you are averaging.

### The Formal Math

This idea is made precise by the integral definition of expectation.

1.  **Standard Expectation:** We integrate the values of `x` weighted by their unconditional probability density $f_X(x)$.
    $$ E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f_X(x) \, dx $$

2.  **Conditional Expectation:** We integrate the same values of `x`, but now we weight them by their **conditional** probability density $f_{X|Y}(x|y)$.
    $$ E[X \mid Y=y] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f_{X|Y}(x|y) \, dx $$

Look closely at the two formulas. In both cases, the term we are averaging is just `x` (the possible values of the random variable `X`). The random variable we are "taking the expectation of" is still `X`. The part that changes is the probability distribution used to perform the weighted average.

### Summary

| Your Interpretation (Common Misconception) | Correct Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 1. Create an object `Z = X|Y=y`. | 1. Identify the random variable to be averaged: `X`. |
| 2. Take the expectation of `Z`. | 2. Identify the condition: `Y=y`. |
| | 3. Find the conditional distribution of `X` given `Y=y`. |
| | 4. Calculate the expectation of `X` using this conditional distribution. |

So, to answer your question directly: we can take the expected value because we are still taking the expectation of the random variable `X`. The notation `| Y=y` simply tells us *which* probability distribution to use for `X` when we do the calculation.
[Timestamp: 2025/07/20 12:51:08]

**user**: is E(X|Y) a probability measure?
[Timestamp: 2025/07/20 12:52:13]

**ai**: That's a fantastic question that gets to the core of these definitions.

The answer is definitively **no, $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y)$ is not a probability measure.**

Let's break down why by comparing what they are.

### What $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y)$ Is

As we've discussed, $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y)$ is a **random variable**.

*   **Type of Object:** A function from the sample space to the real numbers ($\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$).
*   **Input:** It takes a specific outcome of the experiment, $\omega \in \Omega$.
*   **Output:** It gives a **real number**, which is the best guess for the value of $X$ given the information $Y(\omega)$. This output can be any real number: positive, negative, or zero. It can be greater than 1.
*   **Example:** If $X$ is the height of a person in cm and $Y$ is their age, $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y)$ is a random variable. If we observe a specific 10-year-old child ($Y=10$), the value of this random variable might be 135 cm.

### What a Probability Measure Is

A probability measure, like the base measure $\mathbb{P}$ on your space, is a **set function**.

*   **Type of Object:** A function from a $\sigma$-algebra to the real numbers ($\mathcal{F} \to [0, 1]$).
*   **Input:** It takes a set (an event), $A \in \mathcal{F}$.
*   **Output:** It gives a **probability**, a number between 0 and 1, inclusive.
*   **Example:** $\mathbb{P}(\{\text{coin flip is heads}\}) = 0.5$. The input is the event {heads}, the output is the number 0.5.

### The Source of Confusion: Conditional Probability

The confusion is very understandable because there is a closely related concept that feels like a measure: **conditional probability**.

Recall that the conditional probability of an event $A$ given a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$ is defined as:
$$ P(A \mid \mathcal{G}) := \mathbb{E}(\mathbb{I}_A \mid \mathcal{G}) $$
where $\mathbb{I}_A$ is the indicator function for the event $A$.

Now, let's analyze this object, $P(A \mid \mathcal{G})$:

1.  Like any conditional expectation, it is a **random variable**. Its value depends on the outcome $\omega$.
2.  Because $0 \le \mathbb{I}_A(\omega) \le 1$ for all $\omega$, it can be shown that $0 \le P(A \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) \le 1$ for all $\omega$.

So, $P(A \mid \mathcal{G})$ is a random variable whose values are always in $[0, 1]$. But it is still **not a probability measure itself**. A measure takes a *set* as input, whereas the random variable $P(A \mid \mathcal{G})$ takes an *outcome* $\omega$ as input.

### The Deeper Concept: Regular Conditional Probability

Your intuition is pointing towards a more advanced concept called a **regular conditional probability distribution**. This is the object that formally behaves like a probability measure that changes depending on the information you have.

For a fixed outcome $\omega$, we can define a function $\mu_\omega(\cdot)$ such that:
$$ \mu_\omega(A) = P(A \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) $$
This function $\mu_\omega$ takes a set $A$ as input and gives a number. It can be shown that for almost all $\omega$, this function $\mu_\omega$ **is a true probability measure** on the original $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$.

### Summary Table

| Object | Type | Input | Output | Is it a Measure? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y)$ | Random Variable | Outcome $\omega$ | A real number (e.g., -5, 10.3) | **No** |
| $\mathbb{P}$ | Probability Measure | Event $A$ | A number in $[0, 1]$ | **Yes** |
| $P(A \mid Y)$ | Random Variable | Outcome $\omega$ | A number in $[0, 1]$ | **No** |
| $\mu_\omega(A) = P(A \mid Y)(\omega)$ | Set Function (for a fixed $\omega$) | Event $A$ | A number in $[0, 1]$ | **Yes** (for almost all $\omega$) |

**In short:** $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y)$ is a random variable that gives you a *value*. A probability measure is a function that gives you a *probability* for a set. They are fundamentally different kinds of mathematical objects.

[Timestamp: 2025/07/20 12:54:11]

**ai**: Of course. This remark is a cornerstone of measure-theoretic probability. It provides the concrete computational formula that connects the abstract definition of conditional expectation to the way we actually calculate it.

Let's break it down piece by piece.

### The Big Idea

The main goal of this remark is to say:

> "The conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ can be calculated just like a regular expectation, but instead of using the original probability distribution of $X$, you use its **conditional probability distribution**."

Now, let's unpack the formal statement.

### Part 1: The Conditional Probability Measure

> `Se puede demostrar que como $P(X^{-1}(\cdot) \mid \mathcal{G})(w)=P_{X}(\ \cdot\ | \ \mathcal{G})$ es medida de probabilidad sobre $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$`

This part establishes the tool we need for the calculation.

1.  **What is `$P_{X}(\cdot \mid \mathcal{G})$`?**
    This is the **conditional probability distribution of X given $\mathcal{G}$**.
    *   The subscript `$X$` tells us this is a distribution on the space where `X` takes its values (the real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$).
    *   The `$\cdot$` is a placeholder for a set. You plug in a Borel set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ (like an interval `[a, b]`).
    *   The expression `$P_X(B \mid \mathcal{G})$` is defined as $P(X \in B \mid \mathcal{G})$. As we've discussed, this is a **random variable**.

2.  **What does the `$(w)$` mean?**
    Since `$P_X(B \mid \mathcal{G})$` is a random variable, it has a specific value for each outcome $\omega$ of the experiment. This value is written as `$P_X(B \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega)$`.

3.  **What is the key statement?**
    The remark states that if you fix an outcome $\omega$, the function that takes a set $B$ and maps it to the number `$P_X(B \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega)$` is a **true probability measure** on the real line ($\mathbb{R}$). This means it satisfies all the axioms: it's non-negative, assigns 1 to the whole space ($\mathbb{R}$), and is countably additive. This is a very powerful result known as the existence of a *regular conditional probability*.

**Analogy:** Think of the original distribution of $X$, let's call it $P_X$, as a single, fixed recipe. The conditional distribution, $P_X(\cdot \mid \mathcal{G})$, is like a whole cookbook. The outcome $\omega$ tells you which page of the cookbook to open, and on that page, you find a complete, valid recipe (a probability measure).

### Part 2: The Integral Formula

> `$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} X(\tilde{w})\, \mathbb{P}_{X}(\tilde{w} \mid \mathcal{G})(w)= \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$$`

This is the computational part. It's a direct parallel to the formula for regular expectation.

Let's first recall the standard formula for expectation:
$$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \, dP_X(x) $$
This formula means "integrate the value `x` against the probability measure of `X`".

Now let's look at the formula from your note. It's important to clarify the notation, which can be a bit confusing.
*   The expression should be understood as being evaluated at a specific $\omega$.
*   The `$X(\tilde{\omega})$` and `$\mathbb{P}_{X}(\tilde{\omega} \mid \dots)$` are just using `$\tilde{\omega}$` as a dummy variable for integration over the real line. A clearer way to write this is:

$$ \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \, dP_X(x \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) $$

Let's compare the two formulas:
*   **Standard Expectation:** `$\mathbb{E}(X) = \int x \, dP_X(x)$`
*   **Conditional Expectation (at $\omega$):** `$\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) = \int x \, dP_X(x \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega)$`

**The structure is identical.** The only thing that has changed is the probability measure we are integrating against.
*   To get the unconditional expectation $\mathbb{E}(X)$, we use the unconditional measure $P_X$.
*   To get the value of the conditional expectation random variable $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ at a specific outcome $\omega$, we use the conditional measure $P_X(\cdot \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega)$ that corresponds to that outcome.

### Summary

In essence, the remark tells you that the abstractly defined random variable $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ isn't just a theoretical construct. Its value for any given outcome $\omega$ can be calculated by:
1.  Finding the specific probability distribution for $X$ that applies given the information contained in $\omega$.
2.  Calculating the mean of that distribution in the standard way, using an integral.

**ai**: Yes, absolutely! You have hit on the most fundamental and powerful way to understand conditional expectation.

**The conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ *is*, by its very definition, a Radon-Nikodym derivative.**

This is not just "going further"; it's the foundational bedrock upon which the entire modern theory of conditional expectation is built. The properties and formulas we've been discussing are consequences of this definition.

Let's walk through how this works.

### 1. The Radon-Nikodym Theorem in a Nutshell

First, let's quickly recall the theorem. It says:

*   **Given:** Two measures, $\nu$ and $\mu$, on the same measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$.
*   **Condition:** $\nu$ must be **absolutely continuous** with respect to $\mu$ (written $\nu \ll \mu$). This means that for any set $A \in \mathcal{F}$, if $\mu(A) = 0$, then it must be that $\nu(A) = 0$. (The measure $\nu$ doesn't put mass where $\mu$ doesn't).
*   **Conclusion:** There exists a measurable function $f$ such that you can represent the measure $\nu$ as an integral with respect to $\mu$:
    $$ \nu(A) = \int_A f \, d\mu \quad \text{for all } A \in \mathcal{F} $$
*   This function $f$ is called the **Radon-Nikodym derivative** of $\nu$ with respect to $\mu$, written as $f = \frac{d\nu}{d\mu}$.

### 2. Defining Conditional Expectation using the Theorem

Now, here is the brilliant step. To define $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$, we construct two specific measures on the smaller space $(\Omega, \mathcal{G})$.

1.  **The "Base" Measure ($\mu$):**
    Let's take our original probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ and simply restrict it to the sets in our sub-$\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$. Let's call this measure $\mu$. So, for any set $G \in \mathcal{G}$, we have:
    $$ \mu(G) = \mathbb{P}(G) $$

2.  **The "Weighted" Measure ($\nu$):**
    Let's define a new measure, let's call it $Q$, which is weighted by our random variable $X$. For any set $G \in \mathcal{G}$, we define:
    $$ Q(G) = \int_G X \, d\mathbb{P} $$
    This new measure $Q$ tells us the "total value of $X$" over the event $G$. (If $X$ can be negative, $Q$ is technically a "signed measure," but the theorem still applies).

3.  **Check the Condition:**
    Is $Q$ absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu$? Let's check. If $\mu(G) = 0$, that means $\mathbb{P}(G) = 0$. When you integrate any function over a set of measure zero, the result is zero. So, $\int_G X \, d\mathbb{P} = 0$, which means $Q(G) = 0$.
    The condition $Q \ll \mu$ holds!

4.  **Apply the Theorem:**
    Since the condition holds, the Radon-Nikodym theorem guarantees the existence of a **$\mathcal{G}$-measurable** function, let's call it $Z$, such that for all $G \in \mathcal{G}$:
    $$ Q(G) = \int_G Z \, d\mu $$

5.  **The Final Step:**
    Now, let's substitute our definitions of $Q$ and $\mu$ back into this equation:
    $$ \int_G X \, d\mathbb{P} = \int_G Z \, d\mathbb{P} \quad \text{for all } G \in \mathcal{G} $$

This is **exactly** the defining property of conditional expectation! The function $Z$ that the Radon-Nikodym theorem provides is what we **define** as the conditional expectation of $X$ given $\mathcal{G}$.

Therefore:
$$ \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G}) := Z = \frac{dQ}{d\mu} $$

### Summary: The Hierarchy of Concepts

You can think of it like this:

1.  **Most Fundamental:** The **Radon-Nikodym Theorem**. It's a general-purpose tool from measure theory.
2.  **The Definition:** We **define** $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ as the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the measure $Q(G) = \int_G X \, d\mathbb{P}$ with respect to the measure $\mathbb{P}$ (both restricted to $\mathcal{G}$).
3.  **The Key Property:** This definition immediately gives us the crucial property that $\int_G X \, d\mathbb{P} = \int_G \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G}) \, d\mathbb{P}$ for all $G \in \mathcal{G}$.
4.  **The Computational Tool:** The remark you asked about before—`$\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) = \int x \, dP_X(x \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega)$`—is the practical formula that allows us to compute the value of this abstractly defined derivative in many cases.

So, your intuition is perfectly correct. The Radon-Nikodym derivative isn't just another related concept; it is the very heart of the modern definition of conditional expectation.

**user**: what i meant is P_X( | \mathcal{G}) should. absolute continiuous with respect to lebeasgue measure .. then we can re write the integral to be \int_{R} x f d_{L}
So E(X|\mathcal{G})(w) should be equal to that integral right?

**ai**: Yes, you are exactly right. That is the precise connection. Your intuition is perfect.

What you've described is how we move from the abstract measure-theoretic definition to the concrete formula used in everyday statistics and applied probability.

Let's formalize your line of reasoning, which is spot on.

### The Chain of Logic

1.  **The General Formula:**
    As we established from your note, for a fixed outcome $\omega$, the value of the conditional expectation is given by an integral with respect to the **conditional probability measure**:
    $$ \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \, dP_X(x \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) $$
    This is a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. It's very general and always true, but it's not always easy to compute directly.

2.  **Introducing the Condition for a PDF:**
    Now, you introduce the key condition. What if the conditional probability measure, $P_X(\cdot \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega)$, is **absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure ($L$)** on $\mathbb{R}$?

3.  **Applying the Radon-Nikodym Theorem (Again!):**
    If this condition holds, the Radon-Nikodym theorem tells us that this conditional measure must have a density function (a PDF) with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We call this the **conditional probability density function**:
    $$ f_{X|\mathcal{G}}(x | \omega) := \frac{d P_X(\cdot \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega)}{dL}(x) $$
    This function $f_{X|\mathcal{G}}(x | \omega)$ is exactly what we think of as the PDF of $X$, given the information from the outcome $\omega$.

4.  **Rewriting the Integral:**
    The definition of the Radon-Nikodym derivative allows us to replace the abstract measure integral with a standard Lebesgue (or Riemann) integral involving the density function:
    $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \, dP_X(x \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \cdot f_{X|\mathcal{G}}(x | \omega) \, dx $$
    Here, `$dx$` is just another way of writing `$dL(x)$`.

5.  **The Final Result:**
    By chaining these equalities, you arrive at exactly the conclusion you proposed:
    $$ \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \cdot f_{X|\mathcal{G}}(x | \omega) \, dx $$

### Concrete Example: The Bivariate Normal

This is precisely what happens in the bivariate normal example from your notes.
*   Let's condition on the random variable $Y$ (which means conditioning on the sigma-algebra $\mathcal{G} = \sigma(Y)$).
*   We know that the conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y=y$ is a Normal distribution.
*   Any Normal distribution is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Its Radon-Nikodym derivative is its famous "bell curve" PDF.
*   Therefore, to calculate $\mathbb{E}(X \mid Y=y)$, we can use the integral formula:
    $$ \mathbb{E}(X \mid Y=y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_c^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_c)^2}{2\sigma_c^2}} \, dx $$
    where $\mu_c$ and $\sigma_c^2$ are the conditional mean and variance. And, of course, we know that the result of this integral is simply $\mu_c$.

**In summary:** Your insight is the crucial bridge between theory and practice. The general definition uses an abstract measure $dP_X$, but if that measure has a density $f$, we can switch to the much more familiar integral $\int x f(x) dx$.
