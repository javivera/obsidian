**user**: >[!Remark]
>Sea $Y$ v.a., $\mathbb{E}(Y^2) < \infty$. El $c\in \mathbb{R}$ que resuelve ${} \min_{c\in \mathbb{R}} \mathbb{E}(Y - c)^2$ es $c= E(Y)$ 

what we mean here is that E(X) is the minimzer if it is a constat.. beacuase we already know that the minimizer is conditional expected value .. roight?

**ai**: Yes, you are absolutely correct. Your intuition is spot on.

The statement that the constant $c$ which minimizes the mean squared error $\mathbb{E}[(Y - c)^2]$ is $c = \mathbb{E}(Y)$ is a specific case of the more general principle you've identified: the conditional expectation is the best mean-square predictor.

Here's how your note explains this connection:

1.  **The General Principle:** As your note states, for a random variable $X \in L^2(\mathbb{P}, \mathcal{F})$ and a sub-$\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$, the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G})$ is the **best mean-square approximation** of $X$ among all $\mathcal{G}$-measurable random variables in $L^2$. This is shown in the corollary:
    $$ \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( X - \mathbb{E}(X \mid \mathcal{G}) \right)^2 \right] \leq \mathbb{E} \left[ (X - Y)^2 \right] $$
    for any $\mathcal{G}$-measurable $Y \in L^2(\mathbb{P}, \mathcal{G})$.

2.  **The Specific Case (Minimizing over Constants):**
    When we want to find the best *constant* predictor $c$, we are essentially restricting our search space. Instead of searching over all $\mathcal{G}$-measurable functions for some arbitrary $\mathcal{G}$, we are searching over the space of *constant functions*.

3.  **Connecting Constants to a $\sigma$-algebra:** The crucial link is provided by the `Lemma` at the end of your note:
    *   It defines $\mathcal{G}$ as the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that makes constant functions measurable.
    *   It shows that this $\sigma$-algebra is the **trivial $\sigma$-algebra**, $\mathcal{G} = \{\varnothing, \Omega\}$.
    *   It then shows that the conditional expectation with respect to this trivial $\sigma$-algebra is simply the unconditional expectation: $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid \mathcal{G}) = \mathbb{E}(Y)$.

Therefore, when you apply the general principle to this specific case:
*   The best predictor $Y$ must be from the space of constant functions (which are $\mathcal{G} = \{\varnothing, \Omega\}$-measurable).
*   The best predictor is $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid \mathcal{G})$.
*   Since $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid \{\varnothing, \Omega\}) = \mathbb{E}(Y)$, the best constant predictor is indeed $c = \mathbb{E}(Y)$.

In short, you are correct. The minimization problem $\min_{c\in \mathbb{R}} \mathbb{E}(Y - c)^2$ is just the general problem of finding the best mean-square predictor, but constrained to the simplest possible space of predictors: the constants.
